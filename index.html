<h1>VGX Live</h1>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Unsure of how to perform your chipmusic live?</li>
  <li>Tired of dragging your laptop to live shows to play chipmusic?</li>
  <li>Always wanted to make your chipmusic performance more dynamic?</li>
  <li>Want a way to showcase your live Sega Mega Drive / Genesis music to the world without just pressing ‘Play’?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Then <p1>VGX Live</p1> is for you! We’re developing a brand new tool enabling you to play your Sega Mega Drive / Genesis live. Simply create your music in Deflemask tracker as usual, then add in loop point commands to divide into blocks. Export your music as a VGM file and using our super simple tool, create a ROM with one or many VGM files ready to perform a live set. <p1>VGX Live</p1> can be used standalone with either one or two joypad controllers and without any need for a laptop. Features include seamless skipping between non-consecutive loops, muting/unmuting instrument channels on the fly and a track display and selection interface. In addition, if you want to have greater control and versatility and experience the true awesomeness of <p1>VGX Live</p1>, you can use a first generation Novation Launchpad to control your music playback via a live performance-tested hardware interface based on the ubiquitous Arduino microcontroller. So what are you waiting for? Give it a go!
